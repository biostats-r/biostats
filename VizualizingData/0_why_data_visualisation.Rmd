# Why is data visualization important?

Data is the core of science and a scientist collects, analyses, presents and reports data on a daily bases.
Data visualization are an important part of scientific work and it needs to be clear, attractive and convincing [@Wilke2019-qp].
A cleverly constructed data vizualization can summarise and condense a large amount of information and help to communicate results to the audience.

First, one needs to choose the best **type of vizualization**, i.e. a figure, a map or a table, to present the data.
Second, not every figure is a good figure.
The data needs to be presented **clear** and the main message needs to be **convincing**.
Finally, there are many elements like colour, text size, linetype that can be used to highlight important information.
It takes skills to succeed in data vizualization, but you are in the right place to learn more about this.

This chapter on data visualization focuses on the basics of how to **vizualize data** and **communicate** scientific results.
Figures are not the only tool to vizualize data and we will also touch upon other types, such as maps and tables.
We will also give advice for how to make "good" figures and tables, what it takes to write figure or table caption, and how best to present data in a report.
We will base this tutorial on the ggplot2 package [@Wickham2011-yw], but also include other useful R packages.
Note that ggplot is not the only way to make figures in R.

```{r ggplot hierarchy, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/painting.png")
