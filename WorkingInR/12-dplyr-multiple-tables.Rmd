# Working with multiple tables

All the `dplyr` functions we have looked at so far work on a single data frame.
This chapter introduces joins, which work on a pair of data frames with at least one identifying variable in common, and the `bind_*` functions which bind two or more data frames together.


## Merging data frames with mutating joins

Mutating joins combine two data frames by matching rows according to one or more identifying variables that are in both data frames.

The most commonly used mutating join is a left join. 
Left joins take all rows from the first data set, and the rows from the second data frame where the values of the identifying variable match the first (Fig. \@ref(fig:left-join-anim)).

```{r left-join-anim, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.cap = "Left join. The coloured column contains the identifiers."}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/left-join.gif")
```

If there are duplicate values in the identifying column, this (Fig. \@ref(fig:left-join-extra-anim)) causes the matching rows to be duplicated.
If the number of rows in the result increases when you were not expecting it, that can indicate that your identifier are not unique.

```{r left-join-extra-anim, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.cap = "Left join. The coloured column contains the identifiers."}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/left-join-extra.gif")
```
Left joins are implemented in `dplyr` with `left_join()`.

Let use `left_join()` to add the location of each island to the penguin data set.

```{r penguin-islands}
# location of the three islands in the penguins dataset.

penguin_islands <- tribble(
  ~ island, ~ Latitude, ~ Longitude, # tribble is a convenient way to make small datasets
  "Torgersen", -64.766667,-64.083333,
  "Biscoe", -64.818569, -63.775636,
  "Dream",  -64.733333, -64.233333, 
  "Alpha", -64.316667, -63)

penguin_islands
```

The first two arguments to `left_join()` are the data frames, the third is the `by` argument which tells the join which column to make the join by.
Here, we are joining by a single column with the same name in both data frames.
It is possible to join by multiple columns and where the columns have different names in each dataset.

```{r penguin-leftjoin}
penguin_small <- penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  slice(1:2) # small version of data for easy viewing


left_join(penguin_small, penguin_islands, by = "island")
```

Only three of the four islands in `penguin_islands` have data in the `penguins` data set. 
Different variants of mutating joins will treat this in different ways.

- `left_join()` takes all rows from the first (left) data frame and matching rows from the second (right). 
- `right_join()` does the opposite to `left_join()`, taking all rows from the second (right) data frame and matching rows from the first.
- `inner_join()` will take only rows that match in both data frames.
- `full_join()` will take all rows from in both data frames.

In all cases, missing values will are given an `NA`.

## All possible combinations

The mutating joins described above give you the rows from each data frame where the identifying variables match.
Sometimes you want all possible combinations of rows.
This is known as the Cartesian product and can be generated with `crosing()`.
`crosing()` works with data frames as well as vectors as shown here.

```{r crossing}
crossing(a = letters[1:3], b = 1:2)
```


## Filtering joins

Filtering joins let you filter one dataset according to whether rows have a match in the a second dataset.

`semi_join()` finds rows that have a matching row

```{r semi-join-anim, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.cap = "Left join. The coloured column contains the identifiers."}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/semi-join.gif")
```

```{r semi-join}
penguin_islands %>% 
  semi_join(penguins, by = "island")
```


`anti_join()` finds rows that do not have a matching row

```{r anti-join-anim, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.cap = "Left join. The coloured column contains the identifiers."}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/anti-join.gif")
```

```{r anti-join}
penguin_islands %>% 
  anti_join(penguins, by = "island")
```

These can be very useful when cleaning data to find problems.

## Binding data frames together

If we have two or more data frames that we want to combine we can one of the `bind_*` functions.

### More columns - `bind_cols()`

If the data frames contain information about the same observations, they can be combined with `bind_cols()`.

So data1, data2, and data3 can be combined to make one data frame with many columns

```{r bind-cols, eval = FALSE}
bind_cols(data1, data2, data3)
```

`bind_cols()` expects that the row order is the same in both datasets, but cannot check this. 
It only checks that the number of rows is the same in each data frame.
If possible, use a join instead.


### More rows - `bind_rows()`

If the data frame contain more observations (rows), and typically at least some of the same columns, they can be combined with `bind_rows()`.
This is useful if, for example, there are data from two years that need combining.

One feature of `bind_rows()` that I find useful is the `.id` argument that makes an extra column for an identifier.

```{r bind-rows, eval = TRUE}
svalbard_islands <-  tribble( ~ island, ~ Latitude, ~ Longitude,
   "Nordaustlandet", 79.558405, 24.017351,
 "Prins Karls Forland", 78.554090, 11.256545)

bind_rows(
  Palmer = penguin_islands, 
  Svalbard = svalbard_islands, 
  .id = "Archipelago")
```
