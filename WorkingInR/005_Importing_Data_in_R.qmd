# Importing data in R

R can import data from files in many different formats. 
For example:

 - csv files with the `readr` package
 - excel files with the `readxl` package
 - xlm files with the `xml2` package
 - netcdf files with the `ncdf4` package
 - shapefiles with the `sf` package
 
In this chapter, you will learn how to import tabular data from an external text file as a tibble.
We will use functions from the package `readr` which is part of the `tidyverse` package, so make sure that you have activated it with `library(tidyverse)`. 

::: callout-note
## Before we start

You must be familiar with tibbles and data types (such as numeric, character, etc).

You will need the following packages (in addition to those installed earlier)

- `here`

**You need to be working in an RStudio project** (see @sec-working-project).
:::

::: callout-note
## Exercise

To import some data, you first need to download some. 

We have made some files available which you can download with 

```{r}
#| label: download
#| eval: false
usethis::use_zip("biostats-r/biostats-data")
```

When asked, agree to delete the zip file.

This will make a new directory called something like "biostats-r-biostats-data-9db4ebe/".
Rename this directory "data". 
You can do this in the RStudio file tab.

:::

## What are tabular data? 

Tabular data are data that is organized in the form of a table with rows and columns. 
A table often has a header, i.e. an additional row that displays variable names.
Here is an example of a formatted table with header:


``` {r}
#| label: tbl-kable
#| tbl-cap: A simple table with header row
#| echo: false
#| message: false
table <- read_delim(file = "data/weather.csv")
knitr::kable(table)
```

In this example, the table consists of 4 variables (columns) and 12 observations (rows) in addition to the header (top row). 
All cell contents are clearly delimited.  

Below is an example of a *non*-tabular dataset. 
This dataset is a list of profiles with recurrent fields (`Name`, `Position`, `Institution`). 
Each profile contains three lines with a `field:value` pair. 

```{r nontabular, echo = FALSE}
cat(readLines("data/profile.txt"), sep = "\n")
```



## File formats

Tabular data may be stored in files using various formats, spreadsheets, etc. 
The most common spreadsheets store data in their own, proprietary file format, e.g. MS Excel which produces `.xls` and `.xlsx` files.
Such formats may be a limitation to data management in R.
Simpler formats such as plain text files with `.txt` or `.csv` should always be preferred when saving data in spreadsheets.


## Delimited files

One of the most common format for storing tabular data is plain text files with a delimiter between the columns.
The delimiter is often a comma or a semi-colon, but other delimiters are possible including tabs.

Comma or semi-colon delimited files are known as CSV files, which stands for **C**omma-**S**eparated **V**alues, and often have a `.csv` extension. They may also have a `.txt` extension.  

In a CSV-formatted file, the data is stored in a similar manner to this: 

``` {r}
#| label: fig-csv-data
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: Contents of a CSV file viewed in the text editor Notepad
#| fig-alt: Screenshot of a CSV file in notepad.
#| out-width: "75%"
knitr::include_graphics("figures/csv.png")
```

For information, this file matches the example in @tbl-kable.
Each line corresponds to a row in the table (including header) and cell contents are separated with a comma `,`.
Note that the period symbol `.` is used as decimal separator.

The use of commas in the CSV format is however not universal. 
Other symbols such as a semi-colon `;` may be used as a delimiter.
This is the case in several European countries where commas are decimal separator.
Here is the same data set as above, this time in the European format:

```{r}
#| label: csv2-data
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: "_Contents of another CSV file_"
#| fig-alt: Screenshot of a CSV file in notepad with columns separated by semi-colons
#| out.width: "75%"
knitr::include_graphics("figures/csv2.png")
```



## Know your data!

There are several reasons why different symbols are used in CSV files.
Among these reasons are:

+ locale, i.e. the parameters that define the language and regional settings (currency, time and date, number format setting) in use on your machine,
+ software-based preferences, the settings which are defined _by default_ by the software that you have used to punch your data,
+ user-based preferences, the settings that _you_ choose when punching or saving data.

It is thus very important to know what your CSV file is made of.
We therefore recommend to systematically inspect your data file before importing in R.
One way to do it is to open the text file in a text editor (for example RStudio), or to read some of the file into R with `read_lines('file.txt')` (the `n_max` argument is useful if there is lots of data) and determine:

+ which symbol is used as decimal separator (`,` or `.`)
+ which symbol is used as delimiter (`,` or `;`)
+ any extra lines of data that need removing

Here is our previous example:
```{r readLines, echo = TRUE}
read_lines("data/weather.csv")
```
In this file, the decimal separator is `.` and the delimiter is `,`.


## Importing delimited files

We can import delimited files such as csv files with `readr::read_delim()`.
`read_delim()` will import the data as a tibble.

In the following example, we import the file `weather.csv` located in the subfolder `data` of the current RStudio project into the object `weather`. 

```{r}
#| label: delim-csv
#| echo: true
#| message: true
library(tidyverse)
weather <- read_delim(file = "data/weather.csv")
```

When the function is executed, the console shows a short series of messages.
In the frame above, the message `Column specification` tells you that the content of the column `month` has been recognized as of data type `character`, and that the three other columns have been recognized as `double` (which is similar to `numeric`).  

Now the tibble `weather` is available in R as you may see in the tab `Environment` (see @fig-csv-env). 

``` {r} 
#| label: fig-csv-env
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: The _tibble_ weather is now stored in R.
#| fig-alt: >
#|   Screenshot of the environment tab showing one object "weather" with 12
#|   obsevations and 4 variables.
#| out-width: "100%"
knitr::include_graphics("figures/csv-env.png")
```

You can display the table as follows:

```{r weather, echo=TRUE} 
weather
```

::: callout-tip
## Remember to assign!

If you don't assign (`<-`) the imported data to a name, the tibble will be printed to the screen and then lost. 
:::

### File paths

The first argument to `read_delim()` is `file`. 
This wants the location of the file on your computer.
Before we can import a file, we have to find it!

You might be tempted to write the absolute path to the file, something like:

``` r
"c:/user/bad13/documents/project/my_file.csv"
```

This would be a bad idea. 
Why?
Because this path only works on your current computer (provided you don't move the file). 
This code won't work for anyone else, so you cannot share the code with your supervisor and have them run it, nor archive it with a manuscript. 
The code is not reproducible.

Much better is to a path relative to your RStudio project (remember to use an RStudio project - for more info about them, read @sec-working-project).
If the contents of your RStudio project looked like this

```{r}
#| label: file-tree
#| column: page-right
#| echo: false
## good
library(fs)
tmp <- file.path(tempdir(), "demo2")
dir_create(tmp)
withr::with_dir(tmp, {
  file_create("my_project.Rproj")
  dir_create("data")
  file_create("data/2022-8-15_lake-tilo-diatoms.csv")
  file_create("data/2022-3-24_lake-tilo-diatoms.csv")
  file_create("data/2022-3-24_lake-tilo-chemistry.csv")
  dir_create("R")
  file_create("R/01_import.R")
  file_create("R/02_analyse.R")

  dir_create("quarto")
  file_create("quarto/manuscript.qmd")
  file_create("quarto/references.bib")
  dir_create("output")
  file_create("output/manuscript.pdf")

  dir_tree()
})
```

Now we could use

``` r
"data/2022-3-24_lake-tilo-chemistry.csv"
```

to access the chemistry data.
If we move the RStudio project to a different location on your computer, or another computer, the code will still work.
You don't even need to type the full name: just type the quote marks and a few characters and autocomplete will start making suggestions.

There is still a problem though. 
When we use a quarto document, the working directory is the directory where the quarto document is stored. 
This can cause some confusion, which we can avoid if we use the `here` package to find the RStudio project root.

Our import code would now look like this

```{r here, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE} 
library("here")
weather <- read_delim(file = here("data/weather.csv"))
```

Using `here` is highly recommended.

::: callout-important
## Forward slashes and backslashes

Remember to use forward slashes `/` to separate directories in the path. 
If you use back slashes `\`, you will get an error as these are used to escape the following character (e.g., `\t` is a tab). 
If you really want back slashes, use two of them `\\` as the first will escape the second.
If you let autocomplete fill in your path, it will do it correctly
:::

### Delimiters

The second argument to `read_delim()` is the column delimiter `delim`.  
It used to be very important to specify the delimiter (or choose a function such as `read_csv()` that had it set by default), but, after a recent update, `read_delim()` will guess what the delimiter is and we only need to specify it if it gets it wrong.

::: callout-note
## Exercise

Import the "weather.csv" data into R and assign it to an name.
:::


### Review the imported data

Once you have imported the data, it is important to inspect it to check that everything has worked as expected.

- does it have the correct number of columns (may indicate problems with the delimiter)
- are the columns the expected type
- are the values correct.

To do this, we can print the object or `View()` it. 
We can also get details of the column specification

```{r}
#| label: spec
spec(weather)
```

Any parsing problems (for example if there text in a column that should be numeric) will be shown with `problems()`

```{r}
#| label: problems
problems(weather)
```

Here, there are no parsing problems so we get a tibble with zero rows.

Let's try another example. 
File weather2.csv has semi-colons as delimiters.

```{r delim-csv2bis, echo=TRUE} 
weather2 <- read_delim(file = "data/weather2.csv")
spec(weather)
```
Here, the message `Column specification` tells you that the content of the columns `month` and `Wind (m/s)` has been recognized as of data type `character`, and that the two other columns have been recognized as `number`. 
While `read_delim()` got things right about the number of variables, something went wrong with the variables as we could expect `Wind (m/s)` to be recognized as `double`.
To find out about this issue we need to review the imported data in the object `weather2` and compare it to the original file `weather2.csv`.

The example above shows the importance of carefully verifying that the imported data in R matches the original data set.
The following figure compares the content of the file `weather2.csv` (@fig-comp-fig left) to the content of the object `weather2` (@fig-comp-fig right):

``` {r}
#| label: fig-comp-fig
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: The data in the object does not match the data in the file.
#| fig-alt: >
#|   Screenshots of the original text file with decimals separated by commas and
#|   the imported object in R, mostly without decimal separators
#| out-width: "100%"
knitr::include_graphics("figures/comp.png")
```

Looking at the rows in both pictures, one can understand that all commas have simply been ignored, excepted those in the last column.
To solve that issue, you must impose the separator using `locale = locale(decimal_mark = ",")`:

```{r delim-csv2ter, echo=TRUE} 
weather3 <- read_delim(
  file = "data/weather2.csv",
  locale = locale(decimal_mark = ",")
)
```

The last column is now recognized as `double` and the data in the object `weather3` matches the data in the file:

``` {r comp2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="_The data in the object now matches the data in the file._", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/comp2.png")
```

::: callout-important
## Decimal seperators

While `readr` can guess the column delimiter, it cannot guess the decimal separator.
The English/American standard is to use "." as the separator. 
In Norway it is common to use a comma as the decimal separator (but "." are also common).
If you don't specify the decimal separator, `readr` assumes that the comma is a thousand separator and ignores it. 
Then the values can be 10x higher than expected.

:::

### read_csv2()

A shortcut for files with a ";" as the column delimiter **and** commas as the decimal separator is `read_csv2()`. 

```{r read-csv2, echo=TRUE} 
weather_csv2 <- read_csv2(file = "data/weather2.csv")
```

Note the message above `Column specification` that indicates which symbols `read_csv2()` has considered when importing the data. The resulting tibble looks correct:

```{r read-csv-tibble2, echo=TRUE} 
weather_csv2
```


::: callout-note
## Exercise

Import the file weather2.csv. Make sure it has imported correctly.

:::

### Useful arguments

`read_delim()` and the other functions discussed above have a multitude of arguments that allow for adjusting the way data is read and displayed. 
Here we review a handful of them.

#### n_max

`n_max` sets a limit to the number of *observations* to be read.
Note that `n_max` does not consider the first row (header) of the data file as an observation. 


```{r nmax, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE} 
weather <- read_delim(
  file = "data/weather.csv",
  n_max = 6
)
```
```{r nmax2, echo=TRUE} 
weather
```


#### skip

The argument `skip` may be used to skip rows when reading the data file.  
Be aware that:

+ the header in the original data file counts as one row,
+ the first row that comes after those which have been skipped becomes the header for the resulting tibble.

In the following example, we read the data file `weather.csv` and skip the first row:

```{r skip, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE} 
weather <- read_delim(
  file = "data/weather.csv",
  skip = 1
)
```

```{r skip2, echo=TRUE} 
weather
```

As expected, the first row (with the header) is skipped, and the data from the observation `January` have become the header of the tibble.
The argument `col_names()` introduced below will be useful for solving this issue.

#### col_names

The argument `col_names` may be used to define the name of the variables/columns of the tibble.

`col_names =` may also be followed by the actual variable names that you want to use.
In that case, write `col_names = c()` and list the names between the parentheses.
Be aware that the first row of the original data file, which would have been the column names, will become the first row of the resulting tibble.
This means that if you want to replace existing names, you should also
use the `skip` argument.

Here is an example:

```{r col-names, echo=TRUE, message = FALSE} 
weather <- read_delim(
  file = "data/weather.csv",
  skip = 1,
  col_names = c("Month", "Temp", "Precip", "Wind")
)
weather
```

If lots of column names are badly formatted, it may be easier to use `janitor::clean_names()` to improve them.

```{r janitor, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE} 
weather <- read_delim(file = "data/weather.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names()
weather
```

#### col_types 

The argument `col_types` may be used to modify the data type of the variables.
This is useful for example when you need to set a variable as `factor` whereas R has defined it as `character`.
Here is an example with three simple variables.

```{r col-types, echo=TRUE} 
counts <- read_delim(file = "data/groups.csv")
```
As the message clearly indicates, the first and last variables are recognized as `double` (i.e. `numeric`) while the second one is recognized as `character`. 
The tibble in the object `counts` displays as follows:
```{r col-types2, echo=TRUE} 
counts
```
Let's use `col_types = cols()` to manually set the data types to `double`, `factor` and `integer`, respectively.

```{r col-types3, echo=TRUE} 
counts <- read_delim(
  file = "data/groups.csv",
  col_types = cols(col_double(), col_factor(), col_integer())
)
```

Now the tibble displays like this, with the correct data types for each column:
```{r col-types4, echo=TRUE} 
counts
```
If you only need to modify one or a few variables, you must name it/them when writing the code:

```{r col-types5, echo=TRUE} 
counts <- read_delim(
  file = "data/groups.csv",
  col_types = cols(group = col_factor())
)
```

The tibble displays like this:
```{r col-types6, echo=TRUE} 
counts
```



`col_types` is particularly useful when importing tabular data that includes formatted dates.
Dates are usually recognized as `character` when their format does not match the expected format set as default (locale, etc).
In the following example, dates entered  as `yyyy-mm-dd` in the last column are recognized as of type `date`:
```{r col-types-dates1, echo=TRUE} 
countsdates <- read_delim(file = "data/groups-dates1.csv")
```

However, in the example below, dates entered as `dd-mm-yyyy` are converted to `character`:

```{r col-types-dates2, echo=TRUE} 
countsdates <- read_delim(file = "data/groups-dates2.csv")
```

To solve this issue, add the function `col_date()` in `cols()` to help R understand how dates are formatted and shall be read.

```{r col-types-dates3, echo=TRUE} 
countsdates <- read_delim(
  file = "data/groups-dates2.csv",
  col_types = cols(date = col_date("%d-%m-%Y"))
)
```

The result is the following tibble now correctly formatted:
```{r col-types-dates4, echo=TRUE} 
countsdates
```


You will find the whole list of `cols()` parameters for `col_types`  [here](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/cols.html){target="_blank"}.

## Very large files

`readr` imports objects into the computers memory. 
This is fine for most datasets. 
But very large datasets (gigabytes) - will not fit into memory and another solution is needed. 
We can use apache arrow with the [`arrow` package](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/dataset.html) or duckDB with [duckplyr](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/).
Both can work with `dplyr` functions to process large datasets efficiently.

:::


### White space delimited files

Some files have white space separating the columns. 
If a single tab is used then `read_delim()` will automatically detect it and work correctly.
Sometimes multiple spaces are used so the columns line up, making the text file easy for humans to read.
`read_delim()` will not work with these files as it expects a single delimiter. 
Instead we can use `read_table()`, shown here with some test data.

```{r}
#| label: read-white-space
read_table(" Species   Value
            Navicula       1
            Cymbella       2")
```
Another type of data you will sometimes see is the fixed width format.
There are no delimiters, but each field has the same position in each row. 
These files can be imported with `read_fwf()`.
Determining the position of each column can be painful unless you have good metadata.

:::

::: callout-tip
## Reading multiple files

If you want to read many files with the **same structure**, you can supply `read_delim()` with a vector of files names.

```{r}
#| label: multiple-files
#| eval: false

# get a vector of files
files <- list.files(path = "data/", pattern = "csv")
files
#> file1.csv file2.csv

# read them in at once
# record paths in a column called filename
read_csv(files, id = "filename")
#> # A tibble: 4 × 3
#>   filename      x     y
#>   <chr>     <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1 file1.csv     1     2
#> 2 file1.csv     3     4
#> 3 file2.csv     5     6
#> 4 file2.csv     7     8
```

If the files do not have identical structures, perhaps one of the files has text where it should have a number, you either have to use the `col_types` argument to convert everything to the same format, or iterate (@sec-iterate) over the files to import and fix them.

:::


## Excel files

Even though we don't recommend you use Excel files for your own data, you need to know how to import such data as you may be given Excel files for find them in a data repository.
To make your analysis reproducible, it is important to keep the files in their original format rather than converting them to CSV so that all the processing is done with code.

Excel files can be imported with the `readxl` package which is installed with `tidyverse` but not loaded until you run `library(readxl)`.
The function `read_excel()` will import the data; it can be worth using `excel_sheets()` first to check the names of the sheets.

```{r}
#| label: read-excel
#| eval: false
library(readxl)
excel_sheets(path = "data/biomass2015.xls")
biomass_l <- read_excel(path = "data/biomass2015.xls", sheet = "Site L")
```

Many of the arguments for skipping rows at the start of the file, enforcing column types, etc, are similar to those in `readr::read_delim()`

## Setting the locale on windows computers

The locale captures the defaults that vary between countries.
If you are using a windows computer, the locale may not have been set correctly.
This would cause the next exercise to fail, and any text with the  Norwegian letters "å", "ø" and "æ" or other diacritics.

Check if there is a problem by running
```{r}
#| label: Sys-getlocale
#| eval: false

Sys.getlocale()

```

If this returns "C", then you have a problem. To see the problem, run `"å"` (with quotes) in the console.

We can fix the problem permanently by editing the .rprofile file with instructions to set the locale correctly. To do this, run

```{r}
#| label: create-rprofile
#| eval: false
usethis::edit_r_profile()
```

This will create and open a .rprofile file.
Now add the following line to the file, save it, and restart R (Session > Restart R).

```{r}
#| label: edit-rprofile
#| eval: false

Sys.setlocale(locale = "Norwegian.UTF-8")
```

Other locale languages are [avaliable](https://learn.microsoft.com/nb-no/cpp/c-runtime-library/language-strings?view=msvc-170&viewFallbackFrom=vs-2017), but always use "UTF-8" character encoding.
