    "text": "4.2 Tests\nYou need to write tests for your package to ensure your functions do what they are supposed to do. They protect you against breaking your package when you edit your code. Tests are run when the package is checked.\nYou can, ideally should, write tests before you write your functions. We can use the testthat package for the tests.\nSet up the testing infrastructure with\n\nusethis::use_testthat()\n\nNow set up a test file for one or more related functions with use_test().\n\nusethis::use_test(name = \"import\")\n\nThis will create and open a file called test-import.R which looks like\n\ntest_that(\"multiplication works\", {\n  expect_equal(2 * 2, 4)\n})\n\nThe first argument of test_that() is a description, second argument is an expression which contains the test. More complex tests might need some additional set-up code in the expression. There are several expect_*() functions to test different aspects of the function, including that errors and warnings are thrown as expected. Each test_that() call can test multiple expectations. You can have multiple test_that() calls per file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntests for import functions\n\n\n\nIf you are writing a package that imports data from files, you need to test this. You can save files for testing in the “tests/testthat” directory. When you load them you will need to testhat::test_path() so the file can be found.\nFor example, if you wanted to test if function my_import() could correctly import a file (“tests/testthat/testdata.csv”) with the correct number of rows, we could use\n\ntest_that(\"import works\", {\n  expect_equal(nrow(my_import(test_path(\"testdata.csv\"))), 10)\n})\n\n\n\nLook for examples of tests on GitHub if you need inspiration.\nFunctions are much easier to test if the functions do one job. This is also best practice when writing functions. For example, if you were writing a package to import, process, and plot logger data, you would make at least three functions to do this, not one function that does everything.",

Don’t include calls to library() or require() in functions (see Section 4.4.1). If you need to change the state, then revert it with when the function finishes. You can do this with withr::defer(). This is better behaved than the base R equivalent on.exit(). Even if the function throws an error, the state of options will be reverted to its original state.\n\nmy_function &lt;- function(x){\n  op &lt;- options(digits = 1) # set options\n  withr::defer(options(op)) #next line\n  print(x)\n}\n\n\n4.3.2 Data validation - expect the unexpected.\nIf you are going to release your package, you need to try to make it idiot proof.

The method will be declared automatically when the documentation (Section 4.4) is made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing further with classes\n\n\n\n\nMake your own generics\n\nUse the more formal S4 or R6 class systems\n\n\n\n\n4.3.4 Ellipses …\nEllipses can be used in two ways when writing functions.\nThe first is to pass unknown arguments to a second function (e.g., plot.cca()).\nIf we make a plot.my_class() function we can use the ellipses so we don’t need to specify all the possible arguments in plot.\n\nplot.my_class &lt;- function(obj, ...){\n  #logic to prepare data for plotting\n  x &lt;- obj$x\n  y &lt;-obj$y\n  plot(x, y, ...)\n}\n\nNow all of arguments to plot.default() can be used.\nThe second way to use ellipses is when there are a variable number of arguments.

    "text": "4.4 Documentation with Roxygen2\nThe documentation for the package lives in man/ in .Rd files. The files are written in a LaTeX like language, that is quite hard to get to right. Fortunately, the roxygen2 package takes most of the pain away as the format is much simpler. Also, some parts of the documentation are automatically generated by inspecting the code, and it is easier to keep the documentation and code in sync because the are in the same file.\nThe roxygen2 comments sit above the function, and start with #' to distinguish them from ordinary comments.\nThe first sentence of the roxygen becomes the title of the help file. Then we can use roxygen tags for the rest of the documentation. Roxygen tags all start with an @. Once you type this, RStudio gives you suggestions.\n@description One paragraph description of what the function does.\n@param argument_name followed by a description of the argument All parameters must be documented.\n@details All the gory details. Possibly several paragraphs (separate with a blank line).\n@return A description of the object returned by the function (if any)\n@examples Working examples which will be run when the package is tested. Examples should run relatively quickly or they become tedious. They need to use library() to load any packages needed other than the package being developed. Any packages loaded by library() need to be declared in the DESCRIPTION file (see Section 4.4.1)\nYou can use markdown to enhance the documentation, including links etc.\n\n4.4.1 Importing functions\nThe roxygen comments are also where you import functions from other packages. This information will be written into the NAMESPACE file so you don’t have to (see the R package book for more information about this file).\nIf you want to use a function from any other package (except base) you need to add the dependency to the package to the DESCRIPTION file.\n\nuse_package(\"dplyr\")\n#use_dev_package(\"packageFromGithub\")\n\nYou can now use a function from dplyr with dplyr::mutate. This gets messy if you need to use lots of functions from a package. Then it is better to import them. We could use\n#' @import dplyr\nto import all functions in the package, or\n#' @importFrom dplyr %&gt;%\nif we want to just import specific functions. This is safer as it minimises the risk of conflicts.\nForgetting to import functions or to declare the dependencies in the DESCRIPTION file are very common problems when checking the package, but the message is informative (@troubleshooting).\n\n4.4.2 Exporting functions\nIf you want to make your function available to users you normally need to export them. You can do this by adding @export to the roxygen comments.\nFunctions extending S3 generics (e.g. plot.myclass()) don’t need to be exported, but it makes it easier for the user to find your function and access the help file.\nOther functions that are not exported are internal to the package, they can be accessed by the user with mypackage:::unexported() but they should not need to do this.\n\n4.4.3 Generate the .Rd files\nConvert the roxygen comments to .Rd files with\n\ndevtools::document() \n\nView the compiled help files by running\n\ndevtools::load_all()\n\nwhich simulates loading the package without having to install it properly. Then you can use ? as normal to get the help (links won’t work)",

    "text": "4.5 Data\nMany packages include data, either because they are needed for examples, or because the aim of the package is to distribute a dataset (probably with some functions to access it).\nData are stored in data/ as .rda files and can be loaded into R with the data() function.\n\ndata(\"penguins\", package = \"palmerpenguins\")\n\nThe best way to add .rda files is to use the function use_data_raw() with the name of the dataset you want create.\n\nuse_data_raw(name = \"dataset1\")\n\nThis will create data_raw/ and add a file called dataset1.R that looks like this.\n\n## code to prepare `dataset1` dataset goes here\n\nusethis::use_data(dataset1, overwrite = TRUE)\n\nAdd the code needed to reproducibly create dataset1, perhaps importing and processing data files that you have copied into data-raw/.\nWhen you run the entire script, the code will create dataset1.rda in data/.\n\n4.5.1 Documenting data\nData in data/ need to be documented. Write the documentation for the data using roxygen2 and save it in R/. I usually call this file data.R and document all the datasets in it.\nIn my traitstrap package, one of the data objects is called trait. Here is the entry from R/data.R:\n#' Trait data\n#'\n#' A dataset containing plant traits in control plots on Svalbard from PFCT4\n#' TraitTrain course.\n#'\n#' @format A data frame with 53940 rows and 10 variables:\n#' \\describe{\n#'   \\item{Taxon}{species name}\n#'   \\item{Site}{site name}\n#'   \\item{PlotID}{plot name}\n#'   \\item{Trait}{trait name with unit}\n#'   \\item{Value}{trait value}\n#' }\n#' @source \\url{http://https://www.uib.no/en/rg/EECRG/114808/plant-functional-traits-course-4}\n\"trait\"\nThe first line gives the title followed by the desciption. The @format field lets you describe the data. The last line has the object name in quotes (note no #’ first).",

Identify the problems, fix them and run check again.\nNow use\n\ndevtools::load_all()\n\nand give your functions a test drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t source() functions\n\n\n\nYou must resist the temptation to source() your functions (or otherwise load them through the RStudio interface).\nThis will cause problems for devtools::load_all() as the sourced functions will mask the versions loaded by load_all(), and may not work properly.
