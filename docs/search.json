After an introduction to R, this book has a tidyverse flavour, showing how to manipulate data with dplyr and make publishable plots with ggplot2. It includes lots of exercises to hone your skills.\n\n\n\nThe data life-cycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour data are precious. Learn how to take care of them with our data life-cycle book.\n\n\n\nStatistics in R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComing soon!\n\n\n\nReproducible documents with R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to write reproducible documents (anything from a course assignment to a thesis or manuscript) in quarto: no more copy-paste nightmares. Quarto is the successor to R markdown (our earlier R markdown book is here). All the biostats books were written in R markdown or quarto; you can see the source code in our repo on GitHub.\n\n\n\nGit and GitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to use version control with our step-by-step guide to setting up and using git and GitHub in RStudio.\n\n\n\nEnough targets to Write a Thesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to run data analysis pipeline for reproducible and scalable workflows.
