    "text": "How to use these books\nGoogle translate does a reasonably job at translating these books into your preferred language.\nDark-mode can be activated by clicking the  icon.\nIf you want to see how we did something, you can see the source code on GitHub by clicking on the  button or the code button at the top of the page.\nYou can make a copy of the books by downloading them from GitHub (or clone them after reading the Git and GitHub book). Some of the functionality (live R in the book) will not work if you do this.\nThere are inevitably various typos, broken links, outdated functions and other errors in these books. They won’t fix themselves. If you find one, please report it by email or through a GitHub issue.\nWorking in R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to import, manipulate and visualise data with our working in R book. After an introduction to R, this book has a tidyverse flavour, showing how to manipulate data with dplyr and make publishable plots with ggplot2. It includes lots of exercises to hone your skills.\n\n\n\nThe data life-cycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour data are precious. Learn how to take care of them with our data life-cycle book.\n\n\n\nStatistics in R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComing soon!\n\n\n\nReproducible documents with R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to write reproducible documents (anything from a course assignment to a thesis or manuscript) in quarto: no more copy-paste nightmares. Quarto is the successor to R markdown . All the biostats books were written in quarto; you can see the source code in our repo on GitHub.\n\n\n\nGit and GitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to use version control with our step-by-step guide to setting up and using git and GitHub in RStudio.\n\n\n\nEnough targets to Write a Thesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to run data analysis pipeline for reproducible and scalable workflows. Our guide to using the targets package will show you how.\n\n\n\nWriting an R package\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to make your code into an R package? Our guide to writing an R package will show you how.",
