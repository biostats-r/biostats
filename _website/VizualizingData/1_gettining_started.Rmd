# Before you start {.facta}

You need to be 
- familiar with different types of data (continous, categorical)
- handle tibbles
- know how to install a package

## Getting started with ggplot

### Install the ggplot2 package
Before using the package for the first time, run the `install.packages()` command:
 
```{r install, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

To activate the package, run this code:
```{r load, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
```

## The basics

ggplot is based on the **grammar of graphics**, a terminology describing the components of a figure.
Let us have a look at these terms.

To produce a figure or plot, we take data values and use elements like dots, squares, lines, and colour to convert the data into a visual graphic.
There are many different ways to make a figure, but there are some rules that apply in general.
A plot is always built on data, and a number of other components called aestetics, geometry and scales.
These different components combined make up a figure

```{r ggplot-hierarchy, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Visualization of how ggplots are built.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/ggplot_setup_final.png")
```

## The code

The basic code for a scatterplot looks something like this:
```{r basic-plot, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x, y, colour)) +
  geom_point()
```


The main function is `ggplot()` and is used to define the data and the aestetics.
The **data** is on object containing the variables to produce the figure.
In the **aestetics**, the position usually x and y are defined, which describes the location on the plot.
In the aestetics other options like colour, linetype or size can be added.
Each other component of the plot is added with `+`.
You can think of it as different layers that are put on top of each other see \@ref(fig:ggplot-hierarchy).



## The Palmer Penguin Example

We will mostly work with the Palmer Penguine data set [@Horst2020-jy].
If you are unfamiliar with the dataset have a look at this webpage: https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins

To install the dataset run this code:
```{r install-palmer, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")

data(package = 'palmerpenguins')
```

The datasets contains 344 data points from 3 different species of penguins, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.
Further, it contains several traits like bill length, depth, flipper length, body mass, sex and year.
```{r first-look, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
penguins
```



## The components

Now we will describe the different components a ggplot is made of.

### Data
To make a figure we use the function `ggplot()`.
The first element in this function is the **data object** containing all the variables that you need to make a figure
Generally, it is advisable to have the data in a long format.

For the penguine example this is how it will look like:

```{r data1, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, results='hide'}
ggplot(data = penguins)

```

The ggplot function will produce an empty plot, but not show any data.


<br/><br/>

### Aestetics
The second element in the `ggplot()` function is called the **aestetics**.
The different elements from the aestetics are used to display the data.
The most important element is the position which describes the location of the data on the plot, usually by x and y.
Other important elements are shape, fill, size, colour, line type and line width, which describe how the data is presented on the plot.

In the penguine example, if we want to plot the bill length against the bill depth, we choose these two variabels as x and y.
As a second aestetics we have chosen to define species as colour.

```{r aestetic, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species))
```

One thing that might be confusing about the argument colour is that it only allows to be a variable, for example `colour = species` or `colour = island`. 
So for example `colour = "red"` does not work.
If you want to choose a specific colour, this has to be done in geom or in scales (see below).

Now the ggplot function has added the x and y axis to the plot.
<br/><br/>

### Geoms
To plot the actual data, you need the **geom function**.
There are many different geom functions that you can choose.
See chapter *3. different plot types* for an overview.

Here, we will use `geom_point()`, which displays the data as points (scatterplot).
Also, the legend is automatically plotted on the right side.

```{r add-geom, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

To come back to the previous point, if you want to make all the points red this can be done in the `geom_point()` function using `colour = "red".
Note that this time we chose `shape = species`, another aestetics to use different symbols for the three species.

```{r red, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, shape = species)) +
  geom_point(colour = "red")
```
<br/><br/>


### Scales
**Sclaes** as the name says is for scaling, converting, inverting.
With scales you can manipulate the labels, breaks, transformations and palettes.
In other words you can manually change the axis text, labels, ticks, add breaks, make transformations, and manipulate aestetics like colour, shape, linetype.

Here is just a small selection to show what is possible.
We can log transform the y axis, change the axis titles, and manipulate the colours.

```{r scales, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species, group = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10(name = "Log bill length in mm") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Bill depth in mm") +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```


### Labs
**Labs** is a useful function to modify the axis labels, titles and legend.

The axis titles can be renamed, and a title and tag can be added.

```{r labs, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species, group = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Bill depth in mm", y = "Bill length in mm", title = "Bill length vs. depth in penguins", tag = "A")
```


### Stats
**Stats** are statistical transformations to summarize objects in the data in different ways.
You can add means or confidence intervals on top of your data.

```{r stats, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species, group = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_summary(fun = "mean", colour = "red", size = 1)
```
<br/><br/>


### Facets
**Facets** can be used to divide the data into different subplots, which can enhance readability of a figure.

In the penguine example we can show 3 different panels for each island.
This way of plotting makes it easy to see which penguine species occurs on each island.

```{r facets, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ island)
```
<br/><br/>


### Themes
**Themes** is a powerful element that controls the look of the plot.
In themes you can change, remove and add the background, gridlines, ticks, text, text size and much more.

In our example, we will change the axis tile text size, the colour of the axis text and change the theme to `theme_minimal()`.

```{r theme, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ island) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text = element_text(colour = "purple"))

```

<br/><br/>


### A ggplots are built with layers
As you can see, there are almost no limits to what you can do in a ggplot.
The trick is to know which element changes what and to remember all the names (i.e. what is axis.text and axis.ticks etc.).

The order in which you code the different components of a plot often does not matter  (although there are discussions around that topic, see here).
You can imagen the different components (geom, scale, stats) of the plot as different layers that are plotted on top of each other.
Usually, the order is not so important, unless something needs to be plotted on top of something else.
But this is easy to spot once you see the plot.

For examle, you want to plot the data below and the mean values on top, and not the other way round.
See below, the red points showing the means have disapeard. So, the things you want on top are plotted after.

```{r wrong-order, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species)) +
  stat_summary(fun = "mean", colour = "red", size = 2) +
  geom_boxplot()

```


## The exercise {.tabset}

### Position x and y
Now it is your turn!
Add the required R code to plot bill length `bill_length_mm` against bill depth `bill_depth_mm`.

```{r position, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = , y = , colour = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()

```

### Colour
Add the required R code to give each species in a different colour.

```{r colour, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = )) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()

```


### Geom
Add the required R code to plot the data as points.

```{r geom, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species)) +
  
  scale_color_viridis_d()


```

## Common mistakes {.tabset}

In the beginning you will make mistakes which will result in error messages, warnings or incomplete plots.
These mistakes often occur when one of the layers is missing, because a `+` is forgotten at the end of a line, due to a typo, or the data or other elements are forgotten.
Let us look at some common mistakes and how the ggplot is displayed or not.
<br><br>


### No data
If you forget to specify the data ggplot will not be able to make a plot and you will get the following error message:

```{r no-data, echo=TRUE, error=TRUE}
ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species)) +
  geom_point()
```


### Missing aesthetics
If you forget to define the aestetics `aes()` you will also get an error message and a empty image:
```{r no-aestetics, echo=TRUE, error=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point()
```

### Missing geometry
If the geometry is missing `geom_point()`, ggplot will draw a empty plot, with axis labels, but show not data, because you have not defined how to plot the data.

```{r no-geom}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species))
```



# What's next? {.facta}
