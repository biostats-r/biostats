An area plot is very similar in appearance to a [line plot](https://biostats.w.uib.no/creating-a-line-plot/){target="_blank"}. It represents a data series based on two numerical variables in the form of a simple line "joining the dots"; however, the area under the line is filled. When more than one response variable is represented, the area plot becomes a multiple or stacked area plot which helps visualize how different components contribute to a total/sum (this will be further explained [here](https://biostats.w.uib.no/creating-a-multiple-area-chart/){target="_blank"}).

Let's see here how to use `ggplot()` to draw such a plot. We will consider the following example where precipitations were measured daily at Lygra, Hordaland in January 2020. Here is the dataframe:
```{r dataframe}
# dataframe
df <- data.frame(day, precipitations)
str(df)
```
<br/><br/>

We map the variables with `aes(day, precipitations)` and use `geom_area()` to draw the plot:
```{r plot}
ggplot(df, aes(day, precipitations)) +
  geom_area()
```
<br/><br/>

As usual, you may change the look of the plot with a handful of arguments. With `fill=` and `alpha=`, you may change the color of the area and its transparency, respectively:
```{r 2D tune}
ggplot(df, aes(day, precipitations)) +
  geom_area(fill="darkblue", alpha=.5) 
```

If you are interested in plotting only one fragment of the data series, you can use `ifelse()` in `aes()`. You may for instance decide to display only the first 15 days of the month with `time<=12`:
```{r partial}
ggplot(df, aes(day, precipitations)) +                       
  geom_area(aes(x = ifelse(day<=15, day, NA))) +
  xlim(1,31)
```
Note the warning message telling you that some data has been excluded (as expected).
<br/><br/>

Alternatively you can highlight a specific interval of the area plot (for example the period January 10^th^-23^th^) by making a two-layered area plot: a first `geom_area()` layer shows the whole interval from January 1^st^ to 31^st^ in dark and a second layer `geom_area()` shows only the interval January 10^th^-23^th^ in orange on top of (and thus hiding) the first layer:
```{r highlight}
ggplot(df, aes(day, precipitations)) +
  geom_area(fill="darkslategrey") +
  geom_area(aes(x = ifelse(day>=10 & day<=23, day, NA)), fill="orange")
```
<br/><br/>

### Adding plot title, axis titles, ticks, labels and other essential elements

In [this section](https://biostats.w.uib.no/topics/data-visualization-with-ggplot2/essential-elements/){target="_blank"}, you will learn how to set/modify all the necessary elements that make a plot complete and comprehensible. Such elements are:

+ [plot title](https://biostats.w.uib.no/title/){target="_blank"}, 
+ [axis title](https://biostats.w.uib.no/axis-titles/){target="_blank"},
+ [axis scale](https://biostats.w.uib.no/axis-scale/){target="_blank"},
+ [axis ticks](https://biostats.w.uib.no/axis-ticks/){target="_blank"},
+ [category labels](https://biostats.w.uib.no/category-labels/){target="_blank"},
+ [legend](https://biostats.w.uib.no/legend/){target="_blank"},
+ [secondary Y-axis](https://biostats.w.uib.no/secondary-y-axis/){target="_blank"},
+ [colors](https://biostats.w.uib.no/choosing-colors-for-your-plot/){target="_blank"},
+ [etc](https://biostats.w.uib.no/topics/data-visualization-with-ggplot2/essential-elements/){target="_blank"}.
