A violin plot has a lot in common with a [boxplot](https://biostats.w.uib.no/creating-a-multiple-boxplot/){target="_blank"}. The difference is that it represents the probability density of the data. Instead of just being a *box delimited by quartiles*, the violin takes the shape of a density curve (positioned vertically).

We will see how to use `ggplot()` to code for a violin plot representing 4 groups of 150 data points each. This example is based on the same data set used to illustrate how to draw [boxplots](https://biostats.w.uib.no/creating-a-multiple-boxplot/){target="_blank"} and [jitter plots](https://biostats.w.uib.no/creating-a-jitter-plot/){target="_blank"}, among others. Here is the dataframe:
```{r dataframe}
# dataframe
df <- data.frame(group, response)
str(df)
```
<br/><br/>

We first map the data with `aes(group, response)` and we use `geom_violin()` to draw the plot. The code is as follows:
```{r plot}
ggplot(df, aes(group, response)) +
  geom_violin()
```
<br/><br/>

As you may notice, the violins look trimmed at the top and bottom. This is the *default* version of the plot where the shape of the violins "stops" with the data range. In other words, the trim is just Ã¦sthetics, it does not mean that data was excluded. If you want to see the violins with their "tails", you will need to use the argument `trim=FALSE`:
```{r trim}
ggplot(df, aes(group, response)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE)
```
<br/><br/>

The colors of the violins are tunable with `color=` and `fill=`:
```{r tune}
ggplot(df, aes(group, response)) +
  geom_violin(color = "blue", fill = "lightblue")
```
<br/><br/>

Finally, if you feel that you are missing the overview over the quartiles, you can always add a layer that shows the boxplots on top of the violins:
```{r boxplots}
ggplot(df, aes(group, response)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "lightgreen") +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, fill = "lightblue")
```
<br/><br/>

### Adding plot title, axis titles, ticks, labels and other essential elements

In [this section](https://biostats.w.uib.no/topics/data-visualization-with-ggplot2/essential-elements/){target="_blank"}, you will learn how to set/modify all the necessary elements that make a plot complete and comprehensible. Such elements are:

+ [plot title](https://biostats.w.uib.no/title/){target="_blank"}, 
+ [axis title](https://biostats.w.uib.no/axis-titles/){target="_blank"},
+ [axis scale](https://biostats.w.uib.no/axis-scale/){target="_blank"},
+ [axis ticks](https://biostats.w.uib.no/axis-ticks/){target="_blank"},
+ [category labels](https://biostats.w.uib.no/category-labels/){target="_blank"},
+ [legend](https://biostats.w.uib.no/legend/){target="_blank"},
+ [secondary Y-axis](https://biostats.w.uib.no/secondary-y-axis/){target="_blank"},
+ [colors](https://biostats.w.uib.no/choosing-colors-for-your-plot/){target="_blank"},
+ [etc](https://biostats.w.uib.no/topics/data-visualization-with-ggplot2/essential-elements/){target="_blank"}.
