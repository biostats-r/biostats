# title: Overlaying a line plot and a bar plot
# author: jonathan
# revised: 28/3/2020

WEB <- c("https://bioceed.uib.no/dropfolder/bioSTATS/Rmd/Visualizing/Multiple/line-bar-plot.html")
GIT <- c("https://github.com/jonathansoule/biostats/blob/master/Visualizing/Multiple/line-bar-plot.Rmd")
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
ID <- as.factor(1:12)
series1 <- runif(12, min = 25, max = 50)
series2 <- runif(12, min = 4, max = 15)
```

A combination that is frequently seen is the overlay of a bar/column chart and a line chart. A typical example of this is the graph displaying temperatures and precipitations in your favorite newspapers or weather forecast website, as illustrated in the picture below.

We will use `ggplot()` to draw such a combined chart. Before going any further, if you are not so familiar with line plots and vertical bar plots, have a quick look at these pages:

+ [Creating a vertical bar plot](https://biostats.w.uib.no/creating-a-bar-plot/){target="_blank"},
+ [Creating a line plot](https://biostats.w.uib.no/creating-a-line-plot/){target="_blank"}.

The dataframe for this tutorial is as follows:
```{r dataframe}
# dataframe
df <- data.frame(ID, series1, series2)
# structure of the dataframe
str(df)
```
<br/><br/>

The following codes draw a bar plot based on `series1` and a line plot based on `series2`:

```{r plots1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = ID, y = series1)) + # bar plot
  geom_col(size = 1, color = "darkblue", fill = "white")

ggplot(df, aes(x = ID, y = series2)) + # line plot
  geom_line(size = 1.5, color = "red", group = 1)
```
```{r plots2, fig.width=10, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}
grid.arrange(
  ggplot(df, aes(ID, series1)) + # bar plot
    geom_col(size = 1, color = "darkblue", fill = "white"),
  ggplot(df, aes(ID, series2)) + # line plot
    geom_line(size = 1.5, color = "red", group = 1),
  ncol = 2
)
```
<br/><br/>

Now, we “just” have to merge these two plots into one figure. But we have to be careful when mapping the data for each plot. Both plots use `ID` for the X-axis; however, the line plot uses `series2` for its Y-axis, while the column plot uses `series`1. This means that we must create a mapping for each of the plot by using `aes()` twice, one for each `geom`:
```{r combined}
ggplot(df) +
  geom_col(aes(x = ID, y = series1), size = 1, color = "darkblue", fill = "white") +
  geom_line(aes(x = ID, y = series2), size = 1.5, color = "red", group = 1)
```
<br/><br/>

Alternatively, since `ID` is the predictor variable for both the line plot and the bar plot, we can place `aes(ID)` in `ggplot()`, but we still have to use `aes()` to map the response variable in each geometry:
```{r combined2, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = ID)) +
  geom_col(aes(y = series1), size = 1, color = "darkblue", fill = "white") +
  geom_line(aes(y = series2), size = 1.5, color = "red", group = 1)
```
The result (now shown here) is identical to the plot above.
<br/><br/>

As you may see here, the two plot types appear correctly in the same graph, as expected. However, both use the same Y-axis and its corresponding scale. Since the range of the line plot is much lower than the column plot, the use of a secondary Y-axis with a more adapted scale is recommended. Click [HERE](https://biostats.w.uib.no/secondary-y-axis/){target="_blank"} if you want to know more about setting up a secondary Y-axis in ggplot2.

Here is the code to set up the secondary Y-axis that fits our example:
```{r secondary-axis}
ggplot(df) +
  geom_col(aes(x = ID, y = series1), size = 1, color = "darkblue", fill = "white") +
  geom_line(aes(x = ID, y = 3 * series2), size = 1.5, color = "red", group = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . / 3, name = "series2"))
```
<br/><br/>

### Adding plot title, axis titles, ticks, labels and other essential elements

In [this section](https://biostats.w.uib.no/topics/data-visualization-with-ggplot2/essential-elements/){target="_blank"}, you will learn how to set/modify all the necessary elements that make a plot complete and comprehensible. Such elements are:

+ [plot title](https://biostats.w.uib.no/title/){target="_blank"}, 
+ [axis title](https://biostats.w.uib.no/axis-titles/){target="_blank"},
+ [axis scale](https://biostats.w.uib.no/axis-scale/){target="_blank"},
+ [axis ticks](https://biostats.w.uib.no/axis-ticks/){target="_blank"},
+ [category labels](https://biostats.w.uib.no/category-labels/){target="_blank"},
+ [legend](https://biostats.w.uib.no/legend/){target="_blank"},
+ [secondary Y-axis](https://biostats.w.uib.no/secondary-y-axis/){target="_blank"},
+ [colors](https://biostats.w.uib.no/choosing-colors-for-your-plot/){target="_blank"},
+ [etc](https://biostats.w.uib.no/topics/data-visualization-with-ggplot2/essential-elements/){target="_blank"}.
