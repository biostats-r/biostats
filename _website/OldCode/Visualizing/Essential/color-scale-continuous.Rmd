Here we will see how to add/change colors to a plot when working with *continuous* variables. To illustrate this, we will use a scatter plot with 3 continuous variables: *values1* which is plotted along the X-axis, *values2* which is plotted along the Y-axis, and *values3* which range will be represented with colors. Here is the code for this reference plot without colors (i.e. *values3* is not involved yet):
```{r code}
ggplot(df, aes(values1, values2)) +
  geom_point()
```
<br/><br/>

### Bringing colors to the dots

To bring colors to the dots as a function of *values3*, we use the argument `color=` in `aes()`, either directly *within* `ggplot()` or *within `geom_point()`*. In the following example, we use `geom_point(aes(color=...))`. Note that we also use `size=2` to increase the size of the dots:
```{r color}
ggplot(df, aes(values1, values2)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = values3), size = 2)
```

The settings by default tell ggplot to use a blue gradient to represent the variable `values3`. This gradient, represented in the legend to the right of the plot, is indexed on `values3`. The lower the value of `values3`, the darker the color of the dot.
<br/><br/>

### Changing the color palette

Instead of a relatively simple blue gradient, you may want to use a palette of nicer colors. The palettes provided by `viridis` or `brewer/distiller` are among the most frequently used. Note that the functions that will apply for continuous variables are:

+ `scale_color_viridis_c()`,
+ `scale_color_distiller()`.

Their use is further explained [HERE](https://biostats.w.uib.no/choosing-colors-for-your-plot/).

### Using a gradient based on two given colors

Now, if you do not find the exact set of colors that you want, you may use the color/gradient of your choice by adding `scale_color_gradient()` with the arguments `low=` and `high=` to the original code. The function will produce a two-color gradient ranging from the color indicated by `low=` to the color indicated by `high=`. Whether you indicate the colors by their [R name](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf){target="_blank"} or by their [Hex code](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) is up to you. Here are two examples:
```{r gradient1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(values1, values2)) +                       
  geom_point(aes(color = values3), size = 2) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "yellow", high = "darkblue")             # left plot, colors coded with R names
ggplot(df, aes(values1, values2)) +                     
  geom_point(aes(color = values3), size = 2) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "#AF7AC5", high = "#E74C3C")             # right plot, colors coded with Hex codes
```
```{r gradient2, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=4}
grid.arrange(
  ggplot(df, aes(values1, values2)) +                       
    geom_point(aes(color = values3), size = 2) +
    scale_color_gradient(low = "yellow", high = "darkblue"),          # left plot, colors coded with R names
  ggplot(df, aes(values1, values2)) +                     
    geom_point(aes(color = values3), size = 2) +
    scale_color_gradient(low = "#AF7AC5", high = "#E74C3C"),          # right plot, colors coded with Hex codes
  nrow=1)
```
<br/><br/>

### Using a gradient based on two given colors and a breaking point

`scale_fill_gradient2()` is a function that also produces a gradient of colors, but this time based on three colors defined by `low=`, `mid=` and `high=`. This color `mid=` is special in the way that you can use it to highlight a breaking point in your data (encoded by the argument `midpoint=`). For example, if the average of the variable `values3` has a special meaning for the interpretation of the data, you may set `midpoint = mean(values3)`. Thus all values close to the average will get a color close to the one defined by `mid=`. Here is the code and the result:
```{r gradient3}
ggplot(df, aes(values1, values2, values3)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = values3), size = 2) +
  scale_color_gradient2(low = "yellow", mid = "darkblue", high = "red", midpoint = mean(values3))
```
