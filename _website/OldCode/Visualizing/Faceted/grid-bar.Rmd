In this tutorial, we will see how to make a grid of bar plots using `facet_grid()`. Such a grid may be useful when your data set contains several categorical predictor variables, and displaying the data in a single graph makes it hardly comprehensible. If you are not so familiar with bar plots or `facet_grid()`, have a quick look at these two pages:

+ [Creating a bar plot](https://biostats.w.uib.no/creating-a-bar-plot/){target="_blank"},
+ [face_grid()](https://biostats.w.uib.no/facet_grid/){target="_blank"}.

<br/>

We will plot the precipitations recorded monthly in 2017, 2018 and 2019 at two Norwegian locations: Lygra and ÃsterbÃ¸. We will thus have three categorical variables: `month`, `year` and `location`, and one response variable `precipitations`. Here is the code for the dataframe:

```{r dataframe}
# dataframe
df <- data.frame(location, year, month, precipitations)
# structure of the dataframe
str(df)
```
<br/><br/>

Our plan is to make a matrix displaying 6 panels, each of which is a bar plot. In these bars plot, the predictor variable `month` and the response variable `precipitations` shall be plotted on the X- and Y-axis, respectively. Eventually the matrix shall show `location` in columns and `year` in rows. To obtain this matrix, we must:

+ map the data for the bar plots by setting up the Ã¦sthetics in the following manner: `aes(x = month, y = precipitations)`,
+ draw the bars by using `geom_col()`,
+ create the matrix by setting up `facet_grid()` like this: `facet_grid(year~location)`.

Here is the code, and the corresponding faceted plot:

```{r plot}
ggplot(df, aes(x = month, y = precipitations)) +
  geom_col() + 
  facet_grid(year~location)
```
<br/><br/>

If the plan was to set up a matrix with `location` in rows and `year` in columns, we should have inverted the variables in `facet_grid()`:
```{r plot2}
ggplot(df, aes(x = month, y = precipitations)) +
  geom_col() + 
  facet_grid(location~year)
```
However, in this particular case, the X-axis is overloaded and the labels are unreadable. 
<br/><br/>

### Improving the look

You may improve the look of a grid by tuning the labels of the matrix. This is further explained [HERE](https://biostats.w.uib.no/modifying-labels-in-faceted-plots/){target="_blank"}.
<br/><br/>

### Alternative plot

This data set may be alternatively plotted in the form of a *grid of clustered/grouped bars*. [HERE](https://biostats.w.uib.no/grid-clustered-barplots/){target="_blank"} is a tutorial for making such a plot.
```{r plot3, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = month, y = precipitations, fill=year)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  facet_grid(location~.) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d()
```
