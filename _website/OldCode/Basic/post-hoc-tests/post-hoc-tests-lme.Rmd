You have been running a [repeated measures ANOVA](https://biostats.w.uib.no/repeated-measures-anova/){target="_blank"} with `lme()` and `anova()`, and the F-test has revealed the existence of a significant difference between some of the tested groups. But which groups? To answer that question, you will need to run the appropriate *post-hoc* tests to assess the significance of differences between pairs of group means. The functions `emmeans()` and `glht()` will help you do this.

We will reuse the example introduced [here (repeated measures ANOVA)](https://biostats.w.uib.no/repeated-measures-anova/){target="_blank"}.
To create the corresponding dataframe, use the following code:
```{r dataframe}
# response variable
rat.weight <- c(164,164,158,159,155,220,230,226,227,222,261,275,264,280,272,306,326,320,330,312)

# predictor variable
time.point <- as.factor(c(rep("week08",5), rep("week12",5), rep("week16",5), rep("week20",5)))

# individual ID
rat.ID <- as.factor(rep(c("rat1","rat2","rat3", "rat4", "rat5"),4))

# dataframe
my.dataframe <- data.frame(rat.ID,time.point,rat.weight)
```
<br/><br/>

For recall, here is the corresponding plot:
```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(my.dataframe, aes(x = time.point, y = rat.weight, group = rat.ID, color = rat.ID)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.25) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```
<br/><br/>

and the model that was fitted with `lme()`:
```{r model}
# linear mixed effect model stored in the object 'model'
model <- lme(rat.weight ~ time.point, random=~1|rat.ID, data=my.dataframe)
```
<br/><br/>

### Alternative 1: running the test with `emmeans()`

`emmeans()` is part of the package `emmeans`, which we first need to activate:
```{r package, eval=FALSE}
library(emmeans)
```
<br/>

The next step consists in "feeding" the linear mixed effect model to `emmeans()`. The syntax is `emmeans(model, pairwise ~ predictor)` where `predictor` is the predictor variable which levels have to be compared pairwise:
```{r emmeans}
# running emmeans()
emmeans(model, pairwise ~ time.point)
```
The output shows first some statistics for each group in the upper part, while the lower part displays the six pairwise comparisons and p-values. Here, all comparisons are associated with a p-value under 0.05.
<br/><br/>

### Alternative 2: running the test with `glht()`

`glht()` is part of the package `multcomp` which we first need to activate:
```{r package2, eval=FALSE}
library(multcomp)
```
<br/>

Running the test with `glht()` involves two steps:

+ feeding the linear mixed effect model to `glht` for which the syntax is `glht(model, linfct = mcp(predictor = 'Tukey'))` where `predictor` is the predictor variable which levels have to be compared pairwise,
+ computing the result table with `summary()`.

Let's apply this to our example:
```{r glht}
# running glht()
post.hoc <- glht(model, linfct = mcp(time.point = 'Tukey'))

# displaying the result table with summary()
summary(post.hoc)
```
The output shows all six pairwise comparisons, p-values and corresponding stars, and all pairwise comparisons are accompanied by a p-value less than 0.05.
