The Mann-Whitney U test (also known as Wilcoxon rank-sum test) allows for comparison of two groups which do not necessarily originate from normal distributions. This means that you may use this test even if the samples have a normal distribution. This is thus a good alternative to [Student’s t-test](http://biostats.w.uib.no/comparing-two-means-t-test/){target="_blank"} when the assumption of normality might constitute a problem.

The function to use in R is `wilcox.test(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are the vectors containing the samples. Let’s use the same example as we have use for [Student’s t-test](http://biostats.w.uib.no/comparing-two-means-t-test/){target="_blank"}:

```{r student}
wilcox.test(Location_A, Location_B)
```
So, the test results in a p-value *greater* than 0.05, thus indicating that the null hypothesis is not to be rejected. The sample means are not significantly different.
