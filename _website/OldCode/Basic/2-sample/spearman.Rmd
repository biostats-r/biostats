Spearman’s rank-order correlation (often called Spearman’s *ρ* or *rho*) is a non-parametric test which measures the monotonic relationship between two ranked variables. This test is often used when [Pearson product-moment correlation](https://biostats.w.uib.no/comparing-two-variables-pearsons-correlation/){target="_blank"} cannot be used because (one of) the assumptions for the test are challenged. Most of the time, the assumptions of normality and linearity will be a reason for not using Pearson’s product-moment correlation.

Spearman’s rho comes with one main assumption: the monotonicity of the relationship between variables. To better understand what monotonic relationship implies, check the following picture taken from Lærd statistics’ [webpage](https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/spearmans-rank-order-correlation-statistical-guide.php){target="_blank"}:

![Monotonicity of the relationship between two variables](https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/img/spearman-1-small.png){width="100%"}
As you may understand, as the first variable increases, the second variable must either increase or decrease in a monotonic manner, but not necessarily in a proportional manner.

Let’s check this with an example. Here we consider weather records for the last 12 months in Bergen. The variables are `rain` and `temperature`, and we’ll try to see whether there is a form of relationship between these variables.

Normality and equal variance are not to be check here, so let’s draw directly a scatter plot:

``` {r scatterplot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = temperature, y = rain)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, color = "red")
```
<br/><br/>
Hard to see any obvious relationship…

Let’s check Spearman’s *ρ*. The function is `cor.test()`. Note that the function is the same as for Pearson’s *r* and Kendall’s *tau*. The extra parameter `method=" "` defines which correlation coefficient is to be considered in the test (choose between `"pearson"`, `"spearman"` and `"kendall"`; if the parameter method is omitted, the default test will be Pearson’s *r*)
``` {r correlation}
cor.test(rain, temperature, method = "spearman")
```
In this test, the null hypothesis `H0` states that there is no relationship between the variables. Here, the p-value is largely greater than 0.05, this null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
