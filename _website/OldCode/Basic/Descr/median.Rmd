The **median** is another measure of the central tendency of your sample. The median is the number “in the middle” of the dataset, the middle value of a series of values sorted from the smallest to the largest.

Providing that your dataset contain an **odd number *n*** of entries, the median is the value of the **((n+1)/2)^th^ entry** in the dataset. If the dataset contains an **even number *n*** of entries, then the median is the ***average* of the values of the (n/2)^th^ and ((n/2)+1)^th^ entries**.

In R, the function that calculates the median is called `median()`:

```{r median}
my.dataset <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
median(my.dataset)
```
