Statistical tests such as [repeated measures ANOVA](https://biostats.w.uib.no/repeated-measures-anova/){target="_blank"} assume **sphericity**, meaning that **the variances of the differences between all possible pairs of groups are equal**. Whereas assumption of normality of distribution may be overlooked in some cases due to the robustness of ANOVA, the assumption of sphericity in repeated measures ANOVA *must* be met. Violating this assumption may severely compromise the interpretation of the test results.

**Mauchly’s sphericity test** checks this assumption for you. The null hypothesis `H0` in this test states that there is no difference in variances for all pairwise group comparisons. In R, the main function is `mauchly.test()`. However, running it is not that straight forward. It involves building a matrix with the dataset to be tested, whereas your data is usually nicely arranged in a dataframe.

Let's see how this is done using the same example as for [repeated measures ANOVA](https://biostats.w.uib.no/repeated-measures-anova/){target="_blank"}. Here, 5 rats are weighed 4 times with intervals of 4 weeks (week8 to 20). This is the code for the dataframe:

```{r dataframe}
# response variable
rat.weight <- c(164,164,158,159,155,220,230,226,227,222,261,275,264,280,272,306,326,320,330,312)

# predictor variable
time.point <- as.factor(c(rep("week08",5), rep("week12",5), rep("week16",5), rep("week20",5)))

# individual ID
rat.ID <- as.factor(rep(c("rat1","rat2","rat3", "rat4", "rat5"),4))

# dataframe
my.dataframe <- data.frame(rat.ID,time.point,rat.weight)
```
<br/><br/>

We start by creating a matrix called `neo` that contains the data `rat.weight`. In that matrix, the 5 individuals will be shown in rows, and time points in column. Here is the code:

```{r matrix}
neo <- matrix(rat.weight, nrow = 5, ncol = 4)
neo
```
<br/><br/>

Now that the matrix is in place, we can used `mauchly.test()` (in combination with `lm()`) to test for sphericity:
```{r mauchly}
mauchly.test(lm(neo ~ 1), X = ~ 1)
```

The output returns a p-value over 0.05 meaning that the null hypothesis stating that there is no difference in variances for all pairwise group comparisons is accepted.
