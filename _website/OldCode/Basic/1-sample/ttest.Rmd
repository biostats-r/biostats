With regards to **t-test**, the function `t.test()` in R may be used. This is a rather simple function which performs both one- and two-sample t-tests (it is thus likely that we will meet that function [elsewhere](https://biostats.w.uib.no/comparing-two-means-t-test/){target="_blank"} in this website).

Assuming that you have stored your sample data in the variable called `scores`, the command to use is `t.test(scores, alternative="ALT", mu = Y)` where:

+ `ALT` shall be replaced by either `greater` or `less` or `two.sided` depending of your alternative hypothesis `Ha`. The null hypothesis `H0` states that the sample mean is NOT different from the population mean. Your alternative hypothesis `Ha` is one of the following:
  - the sample mean is **greater** than the population mean (in that case, use `greater`),
  - the sample mean is **less than** the population mean (in that case, use `less`),
  - the sample mean is **either smaller or greater** than the population mean (in that case, use `two.sided`).
  
+ `Y` shall be replaced by the value of the population mean.

Using our previous example, this looks like:
```{r ttest}
t.test(scores, alternative="greater", mu=120)
```
 
R returns several lines of text. One of them provides a **p-value** while the next line states the **alternative hypothesis** which depends on the parameter `alternative` that you have entered in the `t.test()`. This alternative hypothesis `Ha` is considered valid when the p-value is less than 0.05.
