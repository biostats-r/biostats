## Introduction

You are interested in the heights of plants in an alpine meadow. 

![Photo credit: Joshua Lynn](./Figures/treeInMeadow.jpg)

You have measured the heights of five of the plant species, entered the values (in cm) into the below table,  and now you want to summarize the plant heights for the meadow.
Notice that the one tree species, *Juniper communis*, is much taller than the other species in this meadow.  

```{r height data setup, echo=FALSE}
# create a height table
Species <- c("Juniper communis", "Betula nana", "Vaccinium myrtillus", "Festuca rubra", "Veronica alpina")
Height <- c(200, 50, 15, 20, 10)
height_data <- data.frame(Species, Height)

#create a second one to show median and mode
Species <- c("Juniper communis", "Betula nana", "Vaccinium myrtillus", "Festuca rubra", "Veronica alpina",
             "Viola biflora")
Height <- c(200, 50, 15, 20, 10, 10)
height_data2 <- data.frame(Species, Height)
```
```{r view table, echo=TRUE, eval= TRUE}
head(height_data) # we use `head()` to look at our data set already loaded into R
```


Descriptive statistics summarize or characterize a given sample and are the foundation of statistical tests and data visualizations.
In this section, we will define a number of descriptive statistics and learn how to calculate them in R using our plant height sample from the above meadow. 

</br>



### Mean

To start, we will describe our height data by its *mean* (or average), which is the most commonly used measure of central tendency of a sample (in our case - height). 
A measure of central tendency describes a typical value within a sample. 
The mean is often called the average and is one of the measures of the central tendency of your sample.
The mean is the sum of all the values in your sample divided by the number of values in the sample set. 
Mathematically described as: 

$$\overline{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}$$ 

Where $\overline{x}$ is the mean of the sample equal to the sum ($\sum$) of all observations, _i_, divided by the total number of observations, _n_. 

In R, the function that calculates the mean is called `mean()`. 
We will first look at our height data and the use the `mean()` function to find the mean for our data:

```{r mean, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
mean(height_data$Height) # then we use the `mean()` function to calculate the mean for our height sample
```

And so, we have a mean of 59 cm for the height of our five plant species. 
But notice how the mean is higher than the height measured for four of the species. 
It seems reasonable to ask: in this case, is the mean an accurate representation of the sample's central tendency?

</br>



### Median

The *median* is another measure of the central tendency of a sample. 
The median is the number “in the middle” of the sample, or, the middle value of a series of values sorted from smallest to largest.
Given that the median only considers the middle of value, it may more accurately estimate a sample's central tendency by not putting as much weight on *outliers*, or values that very are different from the rest of the sample.

Provided that the sample contains an odd number _n_ of entries, the median is the value of the $(\frac{(n+1)}{2})$ entry in the sample. 
If the sample contains an even number _n_ of entries, then the median is the mean of the values of the $(\frac{n}{2})$ and the $(\frac{n}{2} + 1)$ entries.

In R, the function that calculates the median is called `median()`:

```{r median odd, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
median(height_data$Height) # takes the median of the height data
```

Above, we have the median height of our odd numbered sample.
Let's say we go back to our meadow and measure the height of a new species, *Viola biflora*.
Now our sample has six entries. 
How does that change the median?

```{r median even, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
head(height_data2) # we use `head()` to look at our new data set already loaded into R 
median(height_data2$Height) # takes the median
```

We see that the median of the even sample is between the two middle values in the data, 15 and 20.

</br>



### 3. Minimum, maximum, range, midpoint, and mode

The *minimum* and *maximum* of a sample are the smallest and largest entries, respectively. 

In R, the functions that calculate the minimum and maximum  are called `min()` and `max()`, respectively:

```{r min and max, echo = TRUE, eval=TRUE}
min(height_data2$Height) # find the minimum
max(height_data2$Height) # find the maximum
```
We see that `min()` picked out the height of the shortest species in our data (*Veronica alpina* and *Viola biflora*) and `max()` picked out the height of the tallest species (*Juniper communis*). 

The *range* defines the spread of the data and is the difference between the minimum and maximum values.
Note, a range may be expressed as a single value (the actual difference between maximum and minimum) or by writing minimum-maximum. 
For instance, the range of the series (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) can be expressed as 9 or 1-10.

In R, the function that calculates the range is `range()`. 
However, `range()` returns a vector that contains the minimum and the maximum, respectively.
To calculate the difference between these values, you may use `diff(range())` or `max()-min()`:

```{r range, echo = TRUE, eval=TRUE}
range(height_data2$Height) # find the range of the sample as a vector
diff(range(height_data2$Height)) # find the range as difference between minimum and maximum values with diff()
max(height_data2$Height)-min(height_data2$Height) # find the range as difference between minimum and maximum values
```
We see that the `range()` returns our minimum and maximum height values, while the other two functions return the difference between the minumum and and maximum height values.

The *midpoint* of a sample is the value equidistant or in the middle between the minimum and the maximum. 
It can be calculated by taking taking the mean of the minumum and maximum value of a sample.

In R, you can calculate the midpoint of a sample with: 

```{r midpoint, echo = TRUE, eval=TRUE}
(max(height_data2$Height) + min(height_data2$Height))/2
```
Notice how the midpoint is still greater than the height of five of the species measured because of the relative tallness of *Juniper communis* compared to the rest of the community.

Finally, the *mode* of a sample is the most frequent or common value. 
A sample may have multiple modes if there are more than one value in the sample that are equally common. 

There is not a standard *mode* function in R, so here, we present a method to find the most common value of a sample.
We will use the `tidyverse` package to manipulate the data and find the *mode* (see the basics in R for more on `tidyverse`):

```{r mode, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
height_mode <- height_data2 %>% # use "pipe operators", `%>%`, to pass the data for further manipulations
  group_by(Height) %>% # group the data by their height values
  summarise(N_height = n()) %>% # count `n()` how many entries have the same value 
  filter(N_height == max(N_height)) # return the mode by pulling out the values with the highest count

height_mode # see the mode
```
We see that the most common value of height in our dataset is 10 cm and there are two species with that height.

### 4. Variance, standard deviation, and standard error

Means and medians describe the central tendency of a sample, but they give us no information on the spread or dispersion of the data used to find this central tendency. 
We cover measures of sample dispersion in this section.

The *variance* (var or $\sigma^2$) corresponds to the mean of the squared differences from the sample mean. 
Mathematically, variance ($\sigma^2$) of the sample (x) is: 

$$\sigma^2 (x) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{x})^2}{n-1}$$

Where we take an entry in the sample, $x_i$, and calculate the difference between its value and the sample mean, $\overline{x}$, then square it. 
Do the same for all the entries, _n_, in the sample. 
Finally, calculate the mean of these squared differences (divide by _n_) and you get the variance. 
Note-variance is always positive because of the squared difference.

In R, the function that calculates the variance is `var()`:

```{r variance, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
var(height_data2$Height) # finds the variance of the sample
```
Here, we get the variance of the height data- the variance is over 27 times larger than the tallest species' height! 
Why might that be?

The *standard deviation* (sd or $\sigma$) is the square root of the variance. 
Unlike the variance, the standard deviation has the same unit as the mean, median or any entry in the sample because of this square root transformation. 
This makes it very useful as it can be used in combination with the mean to define how values are spread around the mean. 
Often, you will find this expressed as mean +/- sd.

In R, the standard deviation is obtained via the function `sd()`. 
Note that you will obtain the same result by calculating “manually” the square root of the variance with `sqrt(var())`:

```{r standard deviation, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
sd(height_data2$Height) # finds the standard deviation of the sample
sqrt(var(height_data2$Height)) # alternative method to find the standard deviation
```
Note how much closer the sd is to the values within our height data.

*Standard error* is a popular way of showing dispersion around a mean for modeling purposes because it further accounts for sampling effort, or the number of values/ replication in the sample, and is used in many frequentist statistical tests (see t-tests page).
The standard error (se or $\sigma_\overline{x}$, given it is a measure of dispersion on a calculated mean $\overline{x}$) is:

$$\sigma_\overline{x} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

Where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the sample and *n* is the number of independent observations in the sample.

There is no standard function to calculate a sample's standard error in R, but many statistical test functions will calculate the standard error for a parameter as part of the output. 
Here is a way to calculate the se from scratch:

```{r standard error, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
sd(height_data2$Height)/sqrt(length(height_data2$Height)) # take the sd of the sample and divide by the square root, `sqrt()`, of the number of observations or `length()` of the sample. 
```
We can interpret the se as the expected "error" in our estimate of mean plant height. 
What would happen to the standard error if we measured the height of every plant in the meadow? 
This is an important point! 
The standard error of a mean estimate approaches zero as we increase the number of observations ($\sigma_\overline{x} \sim 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$).
Given that many tests in frequentist statistics (e.g., t-tests) use se to determine "significance" of results, increasing sample size will increase the probability of obtaining a statistically significant result, even if the estimate is biologically negligible. 
To further exemplify this fact, see the below figure where tree height mean is the same in the two samples (the points), but one sample has three times the number of observations (*n*) and much smaller se (the lines passing through the points):

```{r stadard error figure, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
Species <- c("Juniper communis", "Betula nana", "Vaccinium myrtillus", "Festuca rubra", "Veronica alpina",
             "Juniper communis", "Betula nana", "Vaccinium myrtillus", "Festuca rubra", "Veronica alpina",
             "Juniper communis", "Betula nana", "Vaccinium myrtillus", "Festuca rubra", "Veronica alpina")
Height <- c(200, 50, 15, 20, 10, 200, 50, 15, 20, 10, 200, 50, 15, 20, 10)
height_data3 <- data.frame(Species, Height)

height_data4 <- bind_rows(height_data, height_data3, .id= "sample") %>%
  group_by(sample) %>% summarize(samp_mean = mean(Height),
                              samp_se = sd(Height)/sqrt(length(Height))) %>%
  mutate(sample = factor(sample)) %>%
  mutate(sample = recode(sample, "1" = "n=5" ,"2" = "n=15"))
  

ggplot(height_data4, aes(x=sample, y= samp_mean)) + geom_point(size=4) +
         geom_linerange(aes(x= sample,ymin=(samp_mean - samp_se), ymax = (samp_mean + samp_se)))+
  scale_x_discrete("Height sample size") + 
  scale_y_continuous("Height mean and se",expand=c(0,0))

```

### 5. Quartiles

Take a sample, sort the data from smallest to largest and split it in four equal subsets.
The quartiles are the values of the sample that cut it off in four.

Quartiles are called:
Q1: the first quartile under which the first 25% of the data in the set can be found,
Q2: the second quartile under which the first 50% of the data in the set can be found (Q2 is also the median),
Q3: the third quartile under which the first 75% of the data in the set can be found.

In addition, one refers to:
Q0: the minimum value in the set,
Q4: the maximum value in the set.

Quartiles give you an idea of how much of your data falls within a specified percentage range. 
Note that the set of data between Q1 and Q3 (which contains the middle 50% of the data) is the interquartile range (IQR).

In R, quartiles may be obtained using the function `quantile()`.
(NB: this is not a typo, quantile refers to the intervals (0, 25, 50, 75, 100%) at which the quartiles, the values in the data, are assessed). 
If you choose to use only `quantile()` with no other argument than the vector containing the sample, R returns Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. 
If you need only Q1, Q2 and Q3, you use an extra argument (see the following example):

```{r quartiles, echo = TRUE}
quantile(height_data2$Height) # Find the Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4
quantile(height_data2$Height, probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)) # Find the Q1, Q2, and Q3 by defining which quartiles (in proportions) using the probs argument
```

Quartiles can be visualized with boxplots in `ggplot()` and `geom_boxplot()`:

```{r quartiles boxplot, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(height_data2, aes(y=Height, x=""))+geom_boxplot()+# assign the vector "x" as the y variable in the 'aes' argument and pass it to 'geom_boxplot' 
  labs(title="Height Boxplot")+ xlab(label="")+ # this and the following lines label the axes and quartiles
  annotate("text", x = 1.1, y = 200, label = "<-Q4 or max")+
  annotate("text", x = 1.42, y = 42.50, label = "<-Q3")+
  annotate("text", x = 1.42, y = 18, label = "<-Q2")+
  annotate("text", x = 1.42, y = 11, label = "<-Q1")+
  annotate("text", x = 1.063, y = 5, label = "^Q0 or min")
```
We can see the distribution of the height data and its quartiles with the boxplot.
The Q2 thick line is the mean, Q0 and Q4 are the min and maxe, respectively, and Q1 and Q3 are the 25% and 75% quartiles, respectively. 
Note how much of an outlier *Juniper communis* is relative to the other species.
