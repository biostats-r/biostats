# Data management plan {#sec-data-managementplan}

A data management plan (DMP) is a formal document that describes how the data in a research project is going to be collected, handled, and kept safe during and beyond the project.
It is becoming more standardized to ask for DMPs in research projects and also PhD projects.

Here are some useful resources for guides to DMPs.
